## Overview ##

This system evaluates the authenticity of Google Play Store applications using a language model (LLM). 
It classifies apps as either fraudulent or genuine based on various factors such as app details, user reviews, permissions, and privacy analysis.

## Data Preparation ##

The script loads data from two JSON files: fraud-apps.json and genuine-apps.json.
It combines them into a single dataset containing app names and their authenticity labels.

## Authentication and App Details Retrieval ##

- Uses the Authentication_Info class to fetch app details, including:
  1.App metadata (name, developer info, downloads, rating, etc.) and user reviews using google_play_scraper library.
  2.App permissions extracted using beautifulsoup library
  3.Self Privacy-related analysis based on whether the data is encrypted or not and is data shared with third party apps.

- A structured prompt is designed for the LLM to analyze app details and classify it as either:
  - Fraud – if the app exhibits suspicious behavior.
  - Genuine – if the app appears legitimate.
- The LLM outputs a dictionary with:
   {
    "type": "fraud" or "genuine".
    "reason": A concise explanation (max 300 characters).
   }

## Classification Process ##

- Each app is processed iteratively, and the LLM provides authenticity predictions.
  If data retrieval fails, predefined app details are used as fallback.

## Evaluation ## 

- The model successfully categorizes apps using LLM-based reasoning.
  The authenticity results can be analyzed further to assess classification accuracy.

## Results ##

- For 'fraud' precision is high but recall is very low
- For 'genuine' precision is little low but recall is high
- Accuracy is also desriable , more better model can produce more better results.


#### Furthur Development ####

- Using more robust model like gpt-4o and deepseek-r1 can give more better results
- Using a pre trained machine learning model for prediction and providing it to the LLM to take this into account
  before analysis can improve the performance by far.
